# Chessproject
This is a web-based offline chess app developed for my 2021 Maturita exam.
It allows to play games locally. Game includes full implementation of chess rules, chess notation and chess clocks (with the option of setting an increment). It also allows the players to save and load games. Players can resign or agree to a draw.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Easy run
To easily run, open `dist/chessproject/index.html` with a live server.
